This project implements some basic data structures like MyArrayList, MyLinkedList, MyStack, MyQueue, and MyMinHeap. These are custom implementations without using Java's built-in collections except for Iterator.

MyArrayList: A dynamic array that grows when full. Supports adding, removing, and accessing elements by index.

MyLinkedList: A doubly linked list for efficient insertion and deletion.

MyStack: A stack (LIFO) based on MyArrayList.

MyQueue: A queue (FIFO) using MyLinkedList.

MyMinHeap: A min-heap that keeps the smallest element at the root, using MyArrayList.

Operations like adding, removing, getting elements, and checking the size are implemented for each data structure.

Time complexity for most operations:

MyArrayList: O(1) for add, O(n) for remove.

MyLinkedList: O(n) for add, remove, get.

MyStack: O(1) for push, pop, and peek.

MyQueue: O(n) for enqueue, O(1) for dequeue and peek.

MyMinHeap: O(log n) for insert and extractMin, O(1) for peek.
